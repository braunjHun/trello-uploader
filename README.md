# Trello XLS Uploader

A small sample Power-Up for Trello .... 

## Setup Prerequisites



### NodeJS

We use [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) to build our Power-Up. Currently, this
project expects that you are running version 12.x

We recommend you use a tool called [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to help
you manage your versions of node. If you have it installed, you can simply run
`nvm i` in this directory to install the right version of node.

### Yarn

We use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) to install and manage our dependencies. Once
you've got Yarn installed, in this directory, you can run `yarn install` to
setup your dependencies locally.

## Resources

Trello has a whole [Developers Site](https://developers.trello.com/) with
various guides and documentation.
